# Tahook

Tahook is a fun and competitive quiz app like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). At the same time, Tahook aims to facilitate *__active recall__* and *__problem solving__*.

## Features

- [x] __Tahook uses open-ended questions.__ There is no guessing or shallow knowledge testing. Instead, Tahook requires the participants to actively retrieve answers from memory. [This is known to be effective from spaced repetition systems.](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/) Moreover, it extends the answer format from dull multiple-choice to creative micro-essays.

- [x] __Tahook leverages peer feedback.__ The free-text answers are evaluated by multiple random peers after the quiz host or a participant has provided an explanation. This gives responsibility to the participants, and it makes it possible to retain the competitive character of the game. (In a future version, participants may receive bonus points for consistently grading others.)

- [ ] __Tahook encourages audience contributions.__ Quiz questions can be created by both the quiz host and by the participants. Participants have an incentive to contribute questions: either if they are genuinely interested in an answer they don't know yet; or if they want to gain a competitive advantage with a question whose answer they already know.

- [ ] __Tahook integrates with knowledge systems__, by allowing import and export with Anki.

- [x] __Tahook uses [peer-to-peer internet connections](https://peerjs.com/).__ This ensures privacy and eliminates server costs, making self-hosting as easy as opening the website, from free static hosting or just from a local HTML file.

- [x] __Tahook is free software.__ Other licensing options may be granted on request.

## Intended audience

Tahook is developed with university tutorials in mind. It may also be well suited for schools, and for pub quizzes.

## Related work

I googled a lot to find a quiz app with open-ended questions, and could not find a proper one. Eventually, I will give a more systematic overview here.
